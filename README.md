# Project Summary

## Synthetic Data Versions
Our project involves two versions of synthetic data for predicting **Risk Level** and **Loan Approval**.

### **Version 1: Large Feature Set**
- Contains **33 feature columns** plus **2 target columns** (Risk Level and Risk Score).
- Provides a detailed feature set but may be overly complex for real-world deployment.

### **Version 2: Reduced Feature Set**
- Contains **15 feature columns** plus **2 target columns** (Risk Level and Risk Score).
- Optimized for efficiency and reduced complexity while maintaining prediction performance.

## **Implementation in Django**
When implementing this model with Django, the focus will be on integrating the machine learning models into the backend API. The setup process will not be emphasized, as the priority is on:
- Creating **API endpoints** for model inference.
- Handling **data preprocessing** before feeding inputs to the model.
- **Serializing model predictions** into JSON responses.
- Implementing **asynchronous requests** for efficiency in model execution.
- Ensuring **security** in handling user data and predictions.

Django REST Framework (DRF) will be used for building the API, and joblib will be utilized to load pre-trained models efficiently.
